# Data Analysis with AI-powered Pandas

Project Overview
This project involves creating and analyzing a sales dataset using advanced data processing and artificial intelligence techniques. The dataset comprises sales information including dates, outlets, products, units sold, price per unit, and total sales. By leveraging the power of OpenAI and the PandasAI library, Aim is to gain valuable insights and perform sophisticated data analysis with natural language prompts.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

  Date: The date of the sale.
  Outlet: The outlet where the sale occurred.
  Product: The product that was sold.
  Units Sold: The number of units sold.
  Price per Unit: The price at which each unit was sold.
  Total Sales: The total sales amount for the transaction.


Tools and Libraries
Python: The programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library for Python, used to manage and analyze the dataset.
PandasAI: An artificial intelligence library that integrates with Pandas to provide AI-driven data analysis using natural language prompts.
OpenAI: The AI engine that powers PandasAI, enabling complex queries and insights from the dataset.

Key Features
Data Generation: Created a comprehensive dataset representing sales transactions across different outlets and products.
AI Integration: Utilized OpenAI's capabilities through the PandasAI library to perform advanced data analysis and generate insights using natural language prompts.
Data Analysis: Conducted various analyses such as sales trends, outlet performance, product popularity, and more, leveraging the combined power of Pandas and AI.
